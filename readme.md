# Web Development Coding Test: Next.js Application with Django API Integration 

Greetings blockhouse team! This is my submission for the web development OA. Please let me know if you have any questions. I had some errors with the candlestick chart package, but was able to get it up and running nonetheless.

## Backend Folder

To run the backend server, initialize the virtual enviroment by using source djangoenv/Scripts/Activate. Then run the 'python manage.py runserver' command. 

## Frontend Folder

To run the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder, and run the commands 'npm install' to install packages, and 'npm run dev', to run the website.
